## Progress
- The bullet was ridiculously complicated but its all over now.
- Both players can shoot a bullet color coded to their tank.
- A cooldown timer to shoot was added
- Hit detection was added, hit box needs tinkering

## Moving Forward
- Connect hit detection to our death animation
- Connect hit detection with incrementing our scoreboard
- Connect hit detection to our respawn function
