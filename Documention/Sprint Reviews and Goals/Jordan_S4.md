# Jordan's Sprint 4 Documentation

### Sprint 3 Review
Sprint 3 consisted of creating a simple Tank class. I then imported the class into main. In the same folder as main, I added two pictures of cartoon tanks I found online. The tanks could spawn at the given XY coordinates, as well as with a given size restriction. <br>
I implemented logic in the loop in main so that one tank would be controlled by the up-down-right-left arrow keys and the other tank controlled by the A-S-W-D keys. Jonathan also worked on Tank controls. Since he went further then me (he made multiple sprites <br>
for the tanks, and changed the direction the tank faced based on the keys pressed), his class will supersede mine. Although my code for this won't likely be in the final implementation, it was enjoyable to get more familiar with Pygame.

### Sprint 4 Goals
For Sprint 4, my goal is to create a Wall class. As the name implies, this class will implement the walls in the game. My main goal for this is to implement logic that constrains where the tanks can drive. Thus, I do not want tanks to be able to drive through walls or <br>
outside of the screen. I hope to implement logic to achieve this goal, as well as potentially logic to prevent the tanks from driving over each other.
