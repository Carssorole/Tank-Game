# Jordan's Sprint 7 Documentation

### Sprint 6 Review
In Sprint 6, tank collision was handled. It was implemented relatively easily by an addition to the player class and a few game updates in main. For each directional key pressed, the other tank will be checked for in a similar fashion to how the wall is checked for. <br>
If the other tank is found, it moves one "step" in the opposite direction of the key pressed. Also, an instructions menu was implemented. Very similar logic to the start menu and game over menus was utilized to make this happen.

### Sprint 7 Goals
For Sprint 7, my task is to create the PowerPoint aspect of our final project. I am a major PowerPoint nerd, so I am definitely looking forward to this! :)
