## Progress
- I added an arcade style font to be used for the scoreboard
- A black bar was added to the top of the screen to better visualize the score
- The score for each player was added onto the black bar, by default its zero.
- Each score total is color coded to the color of the player to be instinctually intuitive.

## Moving Forward
- I will be turning the scoreboard into a jumbotron with animations.
