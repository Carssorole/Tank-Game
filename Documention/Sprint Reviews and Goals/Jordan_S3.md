# Jordan's Sprint 3 Documentation

### Sprint 2 Review
Sprint 2 consisted of downloading Pygame to my computer and importing it into the Tank Game project. I successfully named the window, set a background color, and drew a colorful shape in the window.

### Sprint 3 Goals
For Sprint 3, my goal is to create a Tank class and an implementation of the class in main. I want to have two pictures of tanks, with one tank controlled by the up-down-right-left arrow keys and the other tank controlled by the A-S-W-D keys.
