# Jordan's Sprint 6 Documentation

### Sprint 5 Review
For Sprint 5, I followed a tutorial and ended up creating both a start screen and a game over screen. I used ChatGPT4 to generate art work, then editted it to include the name of the game. For both the start screen and the game over screen, "Enter" either starts or <br>
restarts the game, and "X" quits the game. In main, game states were implemented so this could function properly. I did not get to the secondary priority of preventing tank collision.

### Sprint 6 Goals
For Sprint 6, my goal is to handle tank collision. This has been a secondary priority for me in the last two sprints, so I would like to get this completed. Also, I will add simple guidelines / instuctions for the user.
