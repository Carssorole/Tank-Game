# Jordan's Sprint 2 Documentation

### Sprint 1 Review
Sprint 1 consistented of downloading PyCharm to my computer, as well as ensuring that a python interpreter was connected to PyCharm. The deliverable was simply a Python file that said "Hello World."

### Sprint 2 Goals
For Sprint 2, my goal is to get more familiar with Pygame by creating a window and changing a few of the window's properties. Additionally, I would like to draw a colored shape in the window.
