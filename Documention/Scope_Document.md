## Scope Document

For this project, we plan to make a simple "Tank Game". Our inspiration is the "Combat" game from Atari. <br> 
Just like in combat, our tank game will have two sprites. The players (as sprites) will try to shoot each other. <br>
They will be able to move around. There will be walls that will act as boundaries for the players. <br>
Currently, our scope only includes one level of play. Thus, there will only be one screen that actually  <br>
includes gameplay. Additionally, we will have a start menu that allows the user to either start the game <br>
or exit the program.
